    <h2>About</h2>
    <paragraph>
      Etwan is a small but cool app that was made
      for users to find out the hidden areas of Google
      that sadly no one searches - the 2nd page.
      Now, you porbably won't get results as good
      as you will in the 1st page but in some situations
      like if you are stuck on a question with limited
      ammount of answers on the internet, the 2nd page is
      super useful. I hope this app helps someone out!
